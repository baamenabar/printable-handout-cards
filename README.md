# Printable cards

Create and edit cards with custom content

Edit them with markdown

Print then

## Why?

Mostly to play with Vuex

I need something to make and print nice handouts for the Pathfinder RPG game I am playing with my kids.

Simple editor of flash cards/handouts with title, image and text field. Text field with markdown sopport. Conceived for a DnD campaign, built as an excercise of Vuejs, Typescript and Vuex (redux).
